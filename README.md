-------
This code was created exclusively for demonstration and academic purposes for a practice called fetching. The site fetching is done from is called mangaworld, an illegal site that has stolen and continues to steal scans from sites committed to the legal and proper dissemination of works that would otherwise not have reached Italy. This tool allows you to bypass the site's ads, bypassing the assholes.
-------
Attention! Using this code except for study is not right and would be criminally punishable.
------
I exclude myself from any type of responsibility and reiterate that the sole purpose is to show an example of fetching via specific https request on elements in a CLI environment in Python.
