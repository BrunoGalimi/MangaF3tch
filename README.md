-------
This code was made for the sole demonstration and academic purpose of a practice called fetching. The site from which fetching is done is called mangaworld, an illegal site that has stolen and still steals scans to make public by making money with advertisements while not making money for sons of bitches by reading the scans they made public anyway. This fetching allows you to evade ads. 
-------
Attention! Using this code except for study is not right and would be criminally punishable.
------
I exclude myself from any type of responsibility and reiterate that the sole purpose is to show an example of fetching via specific https request on elements in a CLI environment in Python.
